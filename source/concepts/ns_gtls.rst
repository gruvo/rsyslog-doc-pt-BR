gtls Network Stream Driver
==========================

This network stream driver implements a TLS
protected transport via the `GnuTLS
library <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/>`_.

**Available since:** 3.19.0 (suggested minimum 3.19.8 and above)

Supported Driver Modes

-  0 - unencrypted trasmission (just like `ptcp <ns_ptcp.html>`_ driver)
-  1 - TLS-protected operation

Note: mode 0 does not provide any benefit over the ptcp driver. This
mode exists for technical reasons, but should not be used. It may be
removed in the future.

Supported Authentication Modes

-  anon - anonymous authentication as described in IETF's
   draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft
-  x509/fingerprint - certificate fingerprint authentication as
   described in IETF's draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft
-  x509/certvalid - certificate validation only
-  x509/name - certificate validation and subject name authentication as
   described in IETF's draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft

Note: "anon" does not permit to authenticate the remote peer. As such,
this mode is vulnerable to man in the middle attacks as well as
unauthorized access. It is recommended NOT to use this mode.

x509/certvalid is a nonstandard mode. It validates the remote peers
certificate, but does not check the subject name. This is weak
authentication that may be useful in scenarios where multiple devices
are deployed and it is sufficient proof of authenticy when their
certificates are signed by the CA the server trusts. This is better than
anon authentication, but still not recommended. **Known Problems**

Even in x509/fingerprint mode, both the client and server certificate
currently must be signed by the same root CA. This is an artifact of the
underlying GnuTLS library and the way we use it. It is expected that we
can resolve this issue in the future.
