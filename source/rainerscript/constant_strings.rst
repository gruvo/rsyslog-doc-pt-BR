Constant Strings
================

String constants are necessary in many places: comparisons,
configuration parameter values and function arguments, to name a few
important ones.

In constant strings, special characters are escape by prepending a
backslash in front of them -- just in the same way this is done in the C
programming language or PHP.

If in doubt how to properly escape, use the `RainerScript String Escape
Online
Tool <http://www.rsyslog.com/rainerscript-constant-string-escaper/>`_.
